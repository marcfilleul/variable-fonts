# A library of variable fonts optimized and ready to use

All the variable fonts found in Google Fonts as of today (March 18th, 2020) + Montserrat

- optimized for Latin/European languages (latin subset with [glyphhanger](https://github.com/filamentgroup/glyphhanger))

## Example files

A basic example to show how to use variable fonts the easiest way.

Nothing fancy here but here are some key points:

- It doesn't work on IE and other old browsers that don't support CSS Variables
- This example works for variable fonts with 2 styles (normal and italic)
- If you use a variable font with no italic style file, you'll have a fake italic
